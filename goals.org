** TODO finish writing the evaluation
*** TODO GT to results association
*** TODO proper AC curve intergrl calcualation
*** TODO prepare folder structure for results
**** Propose: results-> exp_name -> [weights, eval file, curve, few image samples, input for training]
**** resluts -> csv with exp_name, AC curve, + ohter metrics (possible longest streak under threshold,50 percentile,90 percetile, 99 precentile)
* Training
** DONE Make method that can annotate the whole dataset based on good weights
** DONE Visualise the results so they make sense
** TODO Kill as many ppl as posssible
